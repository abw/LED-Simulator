# LED-Simulator

This is a browser-based React application which simulates
an LED matrix like the one I built and demonstrated in
[this video](https://youtu.be/9LTRPMgsqeI?t=1713).

The purpose is to provide a playground for quickly
developing, testing and debugging patterns.

## Running the Application

You will need to have [node](https://nodejs.org/) and
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.

In the project directory, you can then run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
